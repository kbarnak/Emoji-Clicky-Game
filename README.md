## Instructions 
The purpose of this app is to utilize React to make a dynamic page that listens for different click events when clicked on an image. 

After each click the app keeps track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

When the user double clicks on an image that results in an incorrect guess and the game will restart.
